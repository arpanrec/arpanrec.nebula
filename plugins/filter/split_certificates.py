"""
This module provides functionality for splitting a string of concatenated certificates
into a list of individual certificates.

The main function, `split_certificates`, takes a string that contains one
or more PEM-formatted certificates and splits it into a list of individual certificates.
Each certificate in the list is a string that begins with
"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and ends with "-----END CERTIFICATE-----".
